# roombox
Spotify song-sharing room prototype from HackNotts 2016 

App that was built in 24-hour hackathon by @Ax3Effect and @tobycode that helps people to suggest songs for a party. Host user makes room, people join that room, and then they can add any song that is available on Spotify. After room is created, new playlist in Spotify is created where all suggested songs are added automatically. 
This project was built using Flask and Spotify API.
